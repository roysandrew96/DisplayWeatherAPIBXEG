# DisplayWeatherAPIBXEG
Example of invoking Weather API with some facade classes to surface the Weather API forecast call as .NET classes more easily.

This simple application is a trivial and barely working example which allows the invocation the Weather API forecasting endpoint, and transforms the
response into a .NET class heirarchy in a much more useful and usable form.
